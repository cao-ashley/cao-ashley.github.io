## Welcome!

I'm a 3rd year PhD student in the department of Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I work as part of the [Water & Carbon Lab](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/gerlein-safdi/) under Cynthia Gerlein-Safdi. 

My work is interested in the impacts of dew on ecosystem function as mediated through vegetation, and I study these complex interactions between dew and plants primarily through process-based modeling, remote sensing, and laboratory experiments.

The chapters of my dissertation are as follows: 
1. Modeling impacts of dew deposition on vegetation at the canopy scale
2. Whole-canopy quantification of dew deposition using paired GNSS sensors
3. Historical and projected global dew trends on vegetation
